## üë©‚Äçüíª Connect the MCP Server to Claude

You can connect your MCP server to any MCP client. Here we provide instructions for connecting it to Claude Desktop.

Open Claude Desktop ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Developers** ‚Üí **Edit Config** and add a new MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hotel-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO\\mcpServer.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop to activate this change. Make sure the new MCP is turned on and has a green circle next to it. If so, you're ready to begin a chat session that can use the tools you've connected.
